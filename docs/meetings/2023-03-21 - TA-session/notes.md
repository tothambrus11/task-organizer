# Week 6 meeting notes
> - **Chair** : Markas
> - **Note-taker**: Chris

- Make commit naming more clear
- Make commits more incremental (reduce size of each commit)

## Checklist:
- Once you have a task, create well-defined (labels, assignee, description, image) issue(s), and create a merge request from that (draft).

- Merge request should be associated with issue.

- Do `/spend 2 hours` in the comment of the merge request, to keep track of time spent.

- Once feature is done, remove "Draft:", and assign reviewer(s) to merge request.

- Try to relate issues to backlog clearly
