# Week 4 - Meeting Notes

> - **Chair** : Alex
> - **Note-taker**: Vitalii

## Main talking points

### Introduction

    Introduction with the chair opening and presenting the talk-topics for today. 


#### Explanation of Bodycheck (Assignment)

    Bodycheck is used to review yourself and your teammates, to asses their abilities and what can they improve. Allows for people to get reflection on their comminucation and work abilities from their teammates. 

    Reflection happens in week 4 and 9

#### What is a meaningful merge-request?

    Even a basic feature implemented is enough for merge-request to be meaningful. Usually around 20+ lines of code (excluding comments).

#### Understanding of a back-end

    Boards will be updated, by users using sockets. For example when a user initally opens the board, they will get a state of the entire board and from then, just updates.
