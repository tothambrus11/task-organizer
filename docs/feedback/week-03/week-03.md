#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Wu Di
Minute taker: Mure≈üan Alexandru

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting had a new *chair* and a *new* minute taker, thumbs up!


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The agenda followed the template and contained very relevant points, that were important to discuss. Most of the topics were quite clear, I felt that some points could have been made a bit more explicit. Moreover, please remember to also add the agenda under the agendas folder on gitlab!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: None.

Feedback: This week's minute taker will receive feedback next week!

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The chairman was really calm and patient with everyone. That really lead the tone for the whole discussion. All topics were covered, but in a bit of a chaotic manner. Try to keep closer to the agenda first, and mention other things that you feel need to be discussed at the end, if there is still time. The meeting can lose it's coherence easily if we give control to something that popped up randomly in our head. Each topic was covered with enough attention.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient!

Feedback: The team took ownership over the meeting, which was great. However, the attitude of the team was split in two. Half of the team was really involved, and was really eager to both talk and actively listen. For the other half of the team, I've seen a few scenarios. Some people did not talk at all, which is why I want to reiterate the importance that you should all contribute! The more unpleasant case was seeing that sometimes, some of you were not paying attention to the ones speaking, by either interrupting them, looking at your phone constantly, or by doing something else, which I felt was a bit disrespectful. Please try to actively listen, to ask questions, to look in the eyes of the people speaking.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You did not present the current state of your application. This should start happening already next week, so I can start to observe some progress.
