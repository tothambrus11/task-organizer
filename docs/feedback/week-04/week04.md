# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Alexandru Mure≈üan
Minute taker: Vitalii Mashkov

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The team has a new chair and a new minute taker, hooray!


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good!

Feedback: The agenda was sent well ahead of time on mattermost, but no agenda has been posted on gitlab yet. Please make sure to post your agendas on GitLab! Edit: The agenda was posted, but on another branch, so it's all good. The agenda had a clear structure and each point was easy to follow by the team. The agenda followed the template provided. I felt like the agenda could have contained a few more points, or at least, each subsection could have had a few bullet points as explanations. In this way the meeting can be better organised. "Make sure everyone knows what to do and how", what exactly do you want to make sure? You could mention future deadlines/assignments/tasks specifically.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The amount of notes was really good but with no clutter, and I liked the fact that the notes weren't cluttered together, the format you used was quite nice and tidy. This made them really easy to follow. The sections you used made everything really nicely structured, well done! Your notes should also contain agreements and people assigned to certain tasks. These agreements should be actionable and realistic.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: I really liked that the chair came well prepared with all the subjects mentioned in the agenda, and also with the relevant things that are happening right now, good job! The chair followed the agenda and was really coherent, which made the meeting quite structured. All the topics received the attention they deserved. 

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The discussion was held with a very warm and friendly tone. The team took ownership of the meeting, and tried to involve me as little as possible. I was really happy that everyone tried to engage and contribute to the discussion, even though there are some people that could still do better. I also encourage the active people to try to engage with the people that seem to not be active. The atmosphere was constructive, and I believe the meeting was valuable to the team. Everyone's ideas were taken into account, and I noticed that you calmly arrived at multiple agreements today quite easily, which is great!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good!

Feedback: The team presented me a mock-up they created, that they will use to develop their frontend. The mock-up was quite detailed which I appreciated. However, I would actually like to see the application running and its state, rather than something that is not "alive". You still made progress, compared to last week, but please remember to put your focus on the code. The team currently looks on a good track to create a working application until the end of the project.
