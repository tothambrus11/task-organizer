#### 1) Self-organization : Excellent!

	Everyone had a really positive energy, the discussion was really friendly and I saw you getting alone nicely, which is great! Even though there were some absentees, you managed to keep the discussion going, asked questions, explained certaing things to eachother, kudos! If you keep it up like this, you can only succeed!

#### 2) Suggested Topics : Good!

	As this was the first meeting we had, I had to lead the discussion so that is understandable, other than that the meeting went quite well. From next week onwards, the chairman should lead the discussion according to the agenda, and should try to engage more with the teammates, rather than me. A great thing would be to share the agenda with the other, so everyone is on board for the meeting.
