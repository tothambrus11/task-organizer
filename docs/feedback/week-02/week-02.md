# Week 2

- **Chair**: Tóth Ambrus 
- **Notetaker**: Aišparas Markas

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting had a chair and also a notetaker. Everyone knew the agenda and everyone arrived on time. Well done!

#### Agenda 

Feedback: Good! The agenda was sent ahead of the meeting, and it contained relevant topics for the discussion. I loved that it also included another ice-breaker as 2 people did not show up last week. I think it would weigh more if you used the official template. Also try to make certain topics or bullet points a bit clearer, with a bit (not a lot) more descriptions.

#### Chair performance

Feedback: Good! The chair followed the agenda closely and lead the discussion with a friendly tone. The chair also actively involved other teammates in questions/debates. One thing you could improve on is trying to look more at the others, as it you were looking a bit too much at your phone for the agenda. Looking at the others when you're speaking also enforces the others to pay attention. 

#### Time management

Feedback: Sufficient! I believe each topic was covered in the appropiate amount of time, but the meeting seemed rushed at parts, and in certain areas I believe the discussion could have been cut short. I suggest leaving topics like solving certain tasks/assignments out of the meeting.

#### Minute taker performance

TA Instructions: Is there a good amount of notes? Do the notes contain the team agreements and the assigned people?

Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Excellent

Feedback: ...

#### Relation

Feedback: Excellent! Everyone was really friendly and engaged in the discussion and was really eager to interact. I believe everyone was given enough space to talk and discuss, in a friendly and calm manner. Well done!
