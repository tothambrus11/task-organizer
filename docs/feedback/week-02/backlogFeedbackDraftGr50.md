### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The backlog was uploaded as a pdf under the docs folder.

### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The structure is thorough and clear and contains the following: stakeholder terminology, a list of prioritised user stories. The level of detail is very high in each of these sections and the language used is easy to follow and does not contain typos.

### Epics

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The backlog contains the epic for a minimal application. The list of epics is complete and almost perfectly follows the right prioritisation. Each epic contains a useful description to clarify the features. You could add mock-ups after the introductions of some of the epics to describe the epic visually.

### User Stories

Mark: Excellent!

Feedback: The user stories follow the correct required format and have a clear focus on the user perspective. The stories themselves only describe one particular workflow and do not overlap with eachother. All of the epics are covered with a good amount of user stories.


### Acceptance Criteria


Mark: Very good!

Feedback: Each user story has a small size and their effect is clear, thus the acceptance criteria is implicit. Maybe think about certain requirements that would require some acceptance criteria, because their fulfillment cannot be easily measured.
