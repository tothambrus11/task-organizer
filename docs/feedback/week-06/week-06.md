# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Markas Aisparas

Minute taker: Cristian Afloroaei

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The team had a new chair and a new note-taker, hooray!


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good!

Feedback: The agenda followed the template and had a clear structure and the topics included were relevant. Please remember to post the agenda on GitLab, and make sure you send the agenda more ahead of time, so the team has time to check it and prepare for the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent!

Feedback: The notes have been posted on GitLab. The amount of notes is really good. The quality of the notes is very high too. I really liked how you structured the notes into different sections. The notes contain concrete agreements and assigned people to tasks, with enough details. The agreements are both actionable and realistic.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: I want to start by saying that you were really informative and helpful to your teammates, and I very much appreciated that. The chair ensured that all topics in the agenda were covered and they received enough attention. What I believe you could improve on, is by trying to create a dialogue with the others, I felt you were the only person talking for quite a long period of time.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good!

Feedback: The team took complete ownership of the meeting. Almost everyone was active in the meeting and in the discussion. I would have maybe liked it more if some of you did not stare at your laptops, and instead look at the others when they are talking. This helps the person speaking, because it actively shows that you are paying attention. The overall atmosphere was friendly and constructive. Everyone's ideas were taken into account. I appreciated that the person that was remotely connected was active in the meeting.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The team presented me with the current state of their application. It is potentially shippable, and there is significant progress compared to when we last met, as the team has a working application and many features implemented. I appreciated that you also took care of styling, the app looks pretty in most places. You are currently on track to create a working application by the end of the project.
